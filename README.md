This is a code quiz that was created using HTML, CSS, Javacript, and a bit of jQuery.
The goal of this project is to create a functioning quiz that gives the User a score based on their performance. When the User clicks the start button the quiz will begin and display a question with a set of choices. When a choice is clicked, correct or not it will proceed to the next question and show the next set of choices. Of course, the app will evaluate whether or not the user got the question right. When the answer is correct it will play a sound and display a message "Correct!". The opposite also happens when the answer is incorrect. When all questions are answered, or if time reaches 0, then the app will go to the End Screen where it displays the User's score and asks for an input for their initials.

*Note: The score is calculated by multiplying the number of correct answers by 10 and adding the second remaining. When the User clicks the wrong answer, the time will decrement by 10 seconds.

After the User inputs their initials, by clicking the submit button the app will save their score and initials and it will be displayed in the View Highscores tab. When the submit button is clicked another button wil appear which will let the User have the option to retake the quiz. 

The User can click the View Highscores tab in the top left which allows them to view the top five scores that are saved in the local storage. There is also a clear button that will erase all scores that were saved and there will also be a button that redirects the User back to the quiz start screen. 

I am not aware of any bugs in the app, but I still intend on refining the app further.
